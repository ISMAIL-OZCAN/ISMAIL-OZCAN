- Hi I'm Ä°smail Ã–ZCAN
- I interested in front-end developing. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and REACT.JS

- Also I'm lawyer at Ä°stanbul province. I interested in the legal side of developing and coding as well. 
- Because, technological and digital products that based on sofwtares and developing processes are directly related with Intellectual Property Rights.
