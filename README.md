- Hi I'm İsmail ÖZCAN
- I interested in front-end developing. 
- I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and REACT.JS

- Also I'm lawyer at İstanbul province. I interested in the legal side of developing and coding as well. 
- Because, technological and digital products that based on sofwtares and developing processes are directly related with Intellectual Property Rights.
